#  AI Level Gen Proof of Concept
This is a quick proof of concept AI level generator.
**You will see a lot of custom engine boilerplate in this project, the ai_level_gen.rs has the relevant ai integrations.**

This is using the Kalosm with an OpenAI backend for classification.
Here is a video review of the project running locally.

# Notes
This is running in my custom Rust game engine, with dependencies on private engine crates, so you won't be able compile this locally.
